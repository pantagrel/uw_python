I am Billings, the Wilding from west Ballard Island. I am strong, tall man. I catch fish, I prepare fish, I feed my people the fish. I fight occasionally against the Technocrats of Alphaville. They come to our land. Recreationally perambulate across it. I throw rocks at them. I shot one once with a gun and killed it. It was young man. Mostly grown. He was alone. No one ever came to look for him. It would be hard to do so. These coasts are rough and raw. People drown in the ocean every season. They think they can swim, but not in these fierce waters. Hidden currents are hands of the ocean gods. Strong, pull you under. They probably thought the young man drowned. 
	Our Wilding coast is a raw, rough coast. Rock and cliff. Tides and currents. We don’t welcome outsiders here. It’s our land. I was sad to take a life, but he could have brought others to our land and I must protect my land and my fish and my trees. The Technocrats are so rich and they take so much and we are so poor and hold tightly to what we can hold to. 
	“Billings,” my wife said to me. “Please take me to the Techocrat town. I will find work there and get medicine for us, for our young Wildings.” 
	I said no. 
	Our young Wildings sometimes sneak into the Technocrat villages. Steal from their rich garbages, microwave popcorn and cookies and pizzas. Rich food. Sometimes they disappear for days when they get a bit of money, go to Alphaville and drink the alcohol and taste the fresh food. Our young Wildings are easy to spot and the Technocrats don’t like us. We look dirty to them, rough and raw. They are young, they act out. They come home, sick from rich cheese and whiskey poisoning, and we steam them clean in thermal caves, and punish them, and life goes on.
