why did we go over this file? regarding the os_path_walk.py
however. the notes regarding the file: 

topdown = False: look into it.


	try/except--
	(except OSError, e:
	    print "blah"
	    
	    'join': adds OS appropriate slashings.
	    /dir/dir/dir/etc
    
dictionaries.
write benchmark structures to test code. good design practice.

consider a dictionary of functions: log them. use them when necessary, quickly.
pass values to, receive values from said functions.

(what's an algorithm? what's a data structure? anyway, both are part of the software design process)
develop data structures first, and then the algorithm: helps guide algorithm development.
